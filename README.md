# amitkhare/slim-hmvc
A HMVC modular application for Slim Framework. Use this application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 with HMVC capebilities.

## Install

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim 3 Framework with modular HMVC.

Via Composer:

    php composer.phar create-project amitkhare/slim-hmvc [my-app-name]

Via Git:

    git clone https://github.com/amitkhare/slim-hmvc.git [my-app-name]
    composer update

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

That's it!
